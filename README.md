# ZigChip8

This project is a deep dive into the world of emulation, crafted to decode the intricacies of bitwise operations and memory management. By developing a Chip-8 virtual machine in the Zig programming language, I've demystified how classic games were run on simple machines, gaining a fundamental understanding of how software directly interacts with hardware at a byte level. Made with the help of SDL2
